# Preparing the mainsail

1. Remove the sail cover. Fold and stow it.
2. Attach the halyard to the head of the mainsail ensuring it is led correctly
   from the masthead to the head of the sail and not wrapped around the mast or
   rigging.
3. Undo the coils of the mainsheet and make sure it is flaked to run free and
   has a figure-of-eight stopper, but keep it jammed until the crew is finished
   working around the boom.
4. Ensure the vang, cunningham, and outhaul are slackened but do not have
   exessive slack.

# Hoisting the mainsail

1. Remove all sail ties from the mainsail
2. Bring the yacht head-to-wind.
3. Ensure the vang, cunningham, and outhaul are slack (but do not have exessive
   slack that could tangle).
4. Send a person to the starboard side of the mast to hoist the mainsail by
   hauling on the mainsail halyard out and down while taking up slack through
   an open jammer in the cockpit.
5. Keep a close eye on the mainsail as it's raised to ensure no fouling or
   jams. Stop if neccesary.
6. Close the jammer and tighten the halyard using the cockpit winch. Watch the
   luff of the sail to ensure correct tension and that the sail is set
   correctly.
7. Tighen the vang, check the outhaul, and tidy the remainder of the halyard
   and stow it inside.
8. The helm can now bear away and begin sailing.

# Reefing the mainsail

!!! Tip

    The DS37 is ususally not rigged with a reefing line of sufficient length to
    be able to preemptively rig the reefing line but still raise the full mainsail.
    If the weather forecast calls for a reef in the main at any point later in your
    sail, it's best to rig and reef the mainsail from the beginning. Reefing the
    main while already underway in overpowered conditions can be quite challenging,
    and is best avoided unless necessary.

1. Remove all sail ties from the mainsail
2. Bring the yacht head-to-wind.
3. Ensure the vang, cunningham, and outhaul are slack (but do not have exessive
   slack that could tangle).
4. Rig the reefing pennant using either of the reefing pennant variations
   outlined below.
5. Send a person to the starboard side of the mast to partially hoist the
   mainsail and hook the reefing cringle to the rams horn. Then continue
   hauling on the mainsail halyard out and down while taking up slack through
   an open jammer in the cockpit.
6. Keep a close eye on the mainsail as it's raised to ensure no fouling or
   jams. Stop if neccesary.
7. Close the jammer and tighten the halyard using the cockpit winch. Watch the
   luff of the sail to ensure correct tension and that the sail is set
   correctly.
8. Tighen the vang, tension the new outhaul (using the reefing pennant), and
   tidy the remainder of the halyard and stow it inside.
9. Tidy the foot of the sail using the elastic sail ties. If the mainsail is
   loose-footed, tie the foot of the sail through the reef points to itself. If
   the mainsail foot is run through the track in the boom, the foot of the sail
   will need to be tied through the reef points and to the boom.
10. The helm can now bear away and begin sailing.

!!! Warning
    If the foot of the sail is tied to the boom (and not to itself), you must
    be **absolutely certain** to remove the reefing tidy lines prior to shaking out
    the reef and raising the mainsail. Failure to do so will rip the mainsail.

## Reefing Pennant Variation 1 - Fixed Eye

1. Open the reefing pennant jammer
2. Haul sufficient slack in by pulling on the reefing pennant at the end of the
   boom
3. Remove the stopper knot in the reefing pennant
4. Run the reefing pennant from the boom end through the reefing cringle at the
   leech of the mainsail
5. Continue down and through the small metal eye on the underside of the boom
   below the reefing cringle
6. Secure with a fixed bowline.

## Reefing Pennant Variation 2 - Running Bowline

1. Open the reefing pennant jammer
2. Haul sufficient slack in by pulling on the reefing pennant at the end of the
   boom
3. Remove the stopper knot in the reefing pennant
4. Run the reefing pennant from the boom end through the reefing cringle at the
   leech of the mainsail
5. Continue down under the foot of the sail and around the boom (make sure the
   pennant is run aft of the small metal eye on the underside of the boom)
6. Secure with a running bowline around the standing end of the reefing pennant.

# Dropping the mainsail

1. Flake the mainsail halyard so that it will run out clean without fouling.
2. Take a few wraps of the mainsail halyard around the winch, with the jammer
   still closed.
3. Bring the yacht head-to-wind.
4. Ensure the vang, cunningham, and outhaul are slack (but do not have exessive
   slack that could tangle).
5. When ready to drop, open the mainsail jammer and whip the coils up and off
   of the winch to release the halyard.
6. Crew at the mast may help bringing the sail down by pulling the luff down.
7. Once the sail is completely down, tighten the mainsheet sufficient to stop
   the boom swinging.
8. Tidy the mainsail around the boom using sail ties.
9. Coil and tidy the mainsail halyard and mainsheet.

# Stowing the mainsail

1. Push all of the mainsail to one side of the boom (the leeward side being
   generally easier).
2. With crew at the mast and the aft of the boom, flake the sail from one side
   of the boom to the other in even folds. Keep pulling the sail aft to keep it
   tidy.
3. Hold the folds in place using sail ties.
4. Secure the mainsail cover to protect the sail.
5. Coil mainsheet in a gasket coil and fasten to hang under the boom.

# Preparing the headsail

1. Attach the headsail tack shackle directly to the D ring at the foot of the
   forestay. Ensure that when the sail is raised the shackle will not be
   twisted at a strange angle which would impact the shape of the sail. An easy
   way to test this is to attach the tack shackle and first piston hank and
   pull the first piston hank upwards to see what the luff along bottom part of
   the sail will look like when stretched).
2. Begin attaching all the piston hanks to the forestay, starting from the
   bottom of the sail and working your way up.
3. Open the headsail halyard jammer, slacken the headsail halyard sufficient to
   attach it to the head of the headsail using the shackle.
4. Rig the headsail port and starboard sheets. If using the jib, make sure to
   run the sheets through both sheet cars and *inside* the shrouds. If using
   the genoa, run the sheets through the first sheet car (the aftmost sheet
   car) and *outside* the shrouds. Finish each sheet with a bowline to the clew
   of the headsail.

# Hoisting the headsail

The DS37 has a simpled hanked on headsail with either a jib or genoa. Some jibs
have battens, while others do not.

1. Remove any sail ties and open the headsail halyard jammer.
2. Slacken the headsail sheets.
3. Haul in on the headsail halyard at the mast and take up slack through the
   open jammer.
4. Watch the sail as it goes up to ensure it does not foul or jam.
5. Close the headsail halyard jammer while tensioning the halyard using the
   winch. Watch the luff of the headsail to get the correct tension.
6. Tidy the remainder of the halyard and stow it inside.

# Dropping the headsail

1. Flake the headsail halyard so that it will run out clean without fouling.
2. Take a few wraps of the headsail halyard around the winch, with the jammer
   still closed.
3. When ready to drop, open the headsail jammer and whip the coils up and off
   of the winch to release the halyard.
4. The crew forward will pull down on the luff and gather the headsail on deck.
5. Keep tension on the headsail sheet to prevent the sail going into the water.
6. Coil up and tidy the halyard and sheets.

# Stowing the headsail

1. Bring the headsail onto the dock.
2. Stretch the foot of the sail along the dock.
3. Working togther, kneel on the sail and grab a fold of sail and place it on
   the foot.
4. Keep the foot stretched and keep flaking the sail.
5. Once the head is reached, fold the sail from the clew towards the luff.
6. Use a webbing sail ties to hold the bundle fast.
7. Stow the headsail in the cabin on the starboard berth.
