# Preparing the mainsail

1. Remove the sail cover
2. Attach the halyard to the head of the mainsail, ensuring it is not wrapped
   on the mast
3. Ensure the mainsheet is flaked to run free and has a figure-of-eight stopper
   knot at the end.
4. Ensure the vang, cunningham, and outhaul are loose (but do not have exessive
   slack)
5. Remove all sail ties from the mainsail

# Hoisting the mainsail

1. Bring the yacht head-to-wind.
2. Ensure the vang, cunningham, and outhaul are slack (but do not have exessive
   slack that could tangle).
3. Ensure all sail ties are removed from the mainsail.
4. Send a person to the starboard side of the mast to hoist the mainsail by
   hauling on the mainsail halyard. This person must coordinate with the person
   on the starboard jammers and winch to take up the slack as the main is
   raised.
5. Keep a close eye on the mainsail as it's raised to ensure no fouling or
   jams. Stop if neccesary.
6. Tension the mainsail halyard using the winch so that the luff is tight, but
   not overly so.
7. Tidy the remainder of the halyard and stow it inside.

# Reefing the mainsail

!!! Tip

    The DS37 is ususally not rigged with a reefing line of sufficient length to
    be able to preemptively rig the reefing line but still raise the full mainsail.
    If the weather forecast calls for a reef in the main at any point later in your
    sail, it's best to rig and reef the mainsail from the beginning. Reefing the
    main while already underway in overpowered conditions can be quite challenging,
    and is best avoided unless necessary.

1. Bring the yacht head-to-wind.
2. Ensure the vang, cunningham, and outhaul are slack (but do not have exessive
   slack that could tangle)
3. Rig the reefing pennant using either of the reefing pennant variations
   outlined below.
4. Send a person to the windward side of the mast to partially hoist the
   mainsail and hook the reefing cringle to the rams horn.
5. Once the forward cringle is secure on the rams horn, continue to hoist the
   mainsail and tension.
6. Tension the the new outhaul by hauling in on the reefing pennant. The foot
   of the sail should be bar tight, but take care not to overdo it.
7. Tidy the foot of the sail using the elastic sail ties. If the mainsail is
   loose-footed, tie the foot of the sail through the reef points to itself. If
   the mainsail foot is run through the track in the boom, the foot of the sail
   will need to be tied through the reef points and to the boom.
8. Tidy the remainder of the halyard and stow it inside.

!!! Warning
    If the foot of the sail is tied to the boom (and not to itself), you must
    be *absolutely certain* to remove the reefing tidy lines prior to shaking out
    the reef and raising the mainsail. Failure to do so will rip the mainsail. 

## Reefing Pennant Variation 1 - Fixed Eye
1. Open the reefing pennant jammer
2. Haul sufficient slack in by pulling on the reefing pennant at the end of the
   boom
3. Remove the stopper knot in the reefing pennant
4. Run the reefing pennant from the boom end through the reefing cringle at the
   leech of the mainsail
5. Continue down and through the small metal eye on the underside of the boom
   below the reefing cringle
6. Secure with a fixed bowline.

## Reefing Pennant Variation 2 - Running Bowline
1. Open the reefing pennant jammer
2. Haul sufficient slack in by pulling on the reefing pennant at the end of the
   boom
3. Remove the stopper knot in the reefing pennant
4. Run the reefing pennant from the boom end through the reefing cringle at the
   leech of the mainsail
5. Continue down under the foot of the sail and around the boom (make sure the
   pennant is run aft of the small metal eye on the underside of the boom)
6. Secure with a running bowline around the standing end of the reefing pennant.

# Preparing the headsail

1. Attach the headsail tack shackle directly to the rectangular metal eye at
   the foot of the forestay. Ensure that when the sail is raised the shackle
   will not be twisted at a strange angle which would impact the shape of the
   sail. An easy way to test this is to attach the tack shackle and first
   piston hank and pull the first piston hank upwards to see what this bottom
   part will look like when stretched)
2. Begin attaching all the piston hanks to the forestay, starting from the
   bottom of the sail and working your way up.
3. Open the headsail halyard jammer, slacken the headsail halyard sufficient to
   attach it to the head of the headsail using the shackle.
4. Rig the headsail port and starboard sheets. If using the jib, make sure to
   run the sheets through both sheet cars and *inside* the shrouds. If using
   the genoa, run the sheets through the first sheet car (the aftmost sheet
   car) and *outside* the shrouds. Finish each sheet with a bowline to the clew
   of the headsail.

# Raising the headsail

The DS37 has a simpled hanked on headsail with either a jib or genoa. Some jibs
have battens, while others do not.

1. Close the headsail halyard jammer.
2. Haul in on the headsail halyard at the mast and take up slack at the
   starboard jammer winch.
3. Tension the halyard until the headsail luff has appropriate tension.
4. Tidy the remainder of the halyard and stow it inside.
