# Staying safe
Like any sport, sailing is not without risk. Ensure you have read and
understood this section, as common mistakes documented here can prevent injury.

# Persons over property

The safety of persons is of paramount importance, and always takes priority
over safety of property. If faced with any situation where either a person will
come to harm OR property will be damaged, *always* prioritize the safety of
persons. Things can be replaced, people can not.

A common mistake that beginners make is to try to stop the boat from coming
into contact with a piling or other vessel by using their feet, hands, or
fingers. The sheer momentum of these vessels will surprise you and will result
in injury, so use fenders instead of limbs.

# Secure footing and staying onboard

Staying onboard and preventing falls is critical on any yacht, and the DS37 is
no different. Always follow _"one hand for the boat, one hand for yourself"_ as
you move around on the yacht. Stay low, move methodically, and avoid rushing,
running, or jumping. Being an older yacht the non-skid on the deck is not as
aggressive and "grippy" as on a newer vessel, so take care. Quality sailing
boots or shoes that provide adequate grip are important, but need not
expensive. Avoid stepping on lines or sails, as both are common causes of slips
or falls. Bad enough if you fall and hurt yourself, but worse to fall
overboard.

!!! note
    The majority of man overboard incidents happen in the harbor. Stay
    vigilant.

# Man Overboard (MOB)

- Shout "Man Overboard!" so that everyone is aware of the situation.
- Throw the floating horseshoe lifering to the casualty, even if they have a
  lifejacket. It will serve as a datum, a method of floatation, and may assist
  with hauling the casualty onboard.
- Assign a person to point at the casualty and maintain constant visual
  contact. This person should never take their eyes off of the casualty in the
  water.
- The skipper will use the VHF or delegate the crew to use VHF to inform the
  other KDY boats or indeed to call for assistance on VHF 16, as appropriate.
- The skipper will decide the appropriate manoeuvre to position the yacht
  alongside the casualty to recover them.
- The crew will recover the casualty, taking care not to get into the water.

!!! Warning
    If there is *any* doubt about a swift or safe recovery, call for assistance
    on VHF 16. The Maritime SAR Convention defines the distress phase as *"a
    situation wherein there is reasonable certainty that a person, a vessel or
    other craft is threatened by grave and imminent danger and requires immediate
    assistance"*.

    __A man overboard at sea in anything but the calmest conditions or warmest
    waters is *almost always* an urgency or distress situation.__

# Cold Water Survival Times
Loss of dexterity and the ability to manipulate fingers, exhaustion or
unconsciousness, and death to drowning or hypothermia can happen more quickly
than most people realize if they are not familiar with cold water survival
times.

!!! Warning
    A casualty in the water with only a buoyancy aid (i.e., not a proper
    lifejacket designed to turn an unconcious casualty upright and keep their
    airway clear of the water) is almost certain to drown upon loss of
    conciousness.

| Water Temperature Degrees C | Water Temperature Degrees F | Loss of Dexterity | Exhaustion or Unconsciousness | Expected Time of Survival |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 0.3 | 32.5 | Under 2 minutes | Under 15 minutes | Under 15 to 45 minutes |
| 0.3 to 4.5 | 32.5 to 40 | Under 3 minutes | 15 to 30 minutes | 30 to 90 minutes |
| 4.5 to 10 | 40 to 50 | Under 5 minutes | 30 to 60 minutes | 1 to 3 hours |
| 10 to 15.5 | 50 to 60 | 10 to 15 minutes | 1 to 2 hours | 1 to 6 hours |
| 15.5 to 21 | 60 to 70 | 30 to 40 minutes | 2 to 7 hours | 2 to 40 hours |
| 21 to 26.5 | 70 - 80 | 1 to 2 hours | 2 to 12 hours | 3 hours to indefinite |
| Over 26.5 | Over 80 | 2 to 12 hours | Indefinnite | Indefinite |


# The boom

The boom on the DS37 is not particularly low, but it always presents a
potential danger as it comes across the deck of the yacht. Make sure to always
keep your head low and clear of the boom during any tacking or gybing
manoeuvres. Calling out "HEADS!" is a good way to remind anyone not paying
attention during a manoeuvre to keep low, so duck your head low if you hear it.

A common mistake on the DS37 is that the helmsman stands too far forward when
on the tiller which can result in being struck by the end of the boom as it
comes across. Use the tiller while seated just aft of the mainsheet on the
windward side. If you must stand while on the helm, be sure to stand far aft
enough to avoid being hit by the boom end.

# The tiller

The rudder on the DS37 is massively oversized for manoeuvrability, which means
that the yacht is quite nimble. One side effect of this is that the lower
portion of the tiller which connects the rudder shaft to the tiller extension
can exert extreme forces and is the perfect height to take out ankles. Take
care not to stand within the swinging path of this lever, as it can easily
break an ankle or foot if the rudder swings violently.

# Mass and momentum

The DS37 is a relatively heavy vessel with tremendous momentum. It should go
without saying that a collision with any significant speed on can and will
cause serious damage to persons or property.

During berthing of the vessel, lines will be taken aboard from the pilings and
used to slow the vessel's forward progress. You cannot stop the vessel in an
instant (and attempting to do so will likely result in injury), so walk along
the deck with the line to slowly absorb the momentum of the yacht ("bend, don't
break").
