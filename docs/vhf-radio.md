!!! Warning

    This brief guide should not be considered a replacement for a proper VHF
    SRC training course and certification. There should always be a qualified VHF
    SRC operator onboard.

## Important VHF Channels for KDY Sailors

| Channel | Description                          |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
|CH 16    | Safety, Urgency, Distress, Calling   |
|CH P1    | KDY Private - Youth training         |
|CH P2    | KDY Private - Sail training          |

## Radio setup

1. Turn the radio on by holding power button until the unit powers on.
2. If the keylock is on (indicated by the :material-key: icon showing up in the
   upper-right of the screen), disable it by holding the :material-key: button.
3. Adjust the volume by using the **VOL/SQL** button to between 15 and 20.
4. Adjust the squelch to the lowest possible setting which still filters out
   background noise (usually 1 or 2).
5. Change the radio channel to **P2** using the arrow keys.
6. Use the **HI/LO** soft-key to ensure the radio is set to high power.
7. Make a [radio check](#radio-check) to another boat.
8. Use the **DW** (dual watch) soft-key to ensure the screen reads DUAL 16 or
   TRI 16.
9. Press and hold the :material-key: button to ensure the keylock is activated.
   (this ensures that no button presses change the channel or settings, but the
   side Push to Talk (PTT) button will work as normal)
10. Secure the radio (usually hung off the stern pushpit rails behind the
    tiller).

!!! Info

    Dual-watch means the radio will monitor the channel selected (e.g., P2),
    but also constantly check VHF CH16 in the background (thus monitoring both
    channels simultaneously). As VHF CH16 is used for safety of navigation,
    urgency, distress, and general initial calling it's important to keep watch on
    this channel at all times. Tri-watch will monitor the selected channel
    (e.g., P2), VHF CH16, and one other channel based on the radio configuration.

    Using the PTT button to transmit on the selected channel (e.g., P2) will
    disable Dual-watch or Tri-watch. Once you are done communicating you should
    always re-enable dual-watch or tri-watch using the DW soft-key.

## Identification

Every radio transmission (except for a MAYDAY) *must* identify both the station
you are calling, and the station making the call (in that order). In the event
of a MAYDAY, you do not need to specify the station you are calling (it is a
broadcast for help), but you must identify yourself.

- Station being called (twice, or once when communication is already established)
- Station calling (once)

!!! Example

    KDY DS37 #1, KDY DS37 #1 *(identify the station being called twice)*

    This is KDY DS37 #2 *(identify the station making the call once)*

    When do you expect to arrive in Skovshoved?

    Over *(This is the end of my trasmission and a reply is expected)*

## Radio Check

The calling station would request a radio check like so:

> KDY DS37 #1, KDY DS37 #1 *(identification)*
>
> THIS IS KDY DS37 #2 *(identification)*
>
> RADIO CHECK. *(Please comment on the strength and quality of my transmission.)*
>
> OVER *(This is the end of my trasmission and a reply is expected)*

The called station, presumably hearing the calling station loud and clear in
this example, would respond:

> KDY DS37 #2 *(identification)*
>
> THIS IS KDY DS37 #1 *(identification)*
>
> RECEIVED LOUD AND CLEAR.
>
> OVER *(This is the end of my trasmission and a reply is expected)*

Finally, the original calling station would reply (to close the loop and
confirm both sides can both receive and transmit):

> KDY DS37 #1 *(identification)*
>
> THIS IS KDY DS37 #2 *(identification)*
>
> Thank you.
>
> OUT *(This is the end of my transmission and no reply is expectd.)*

## Urgency Call (PAN-PAN)

An urgency call (PAN-PAN) is used when *"the calling station has very urgent
information to transmit concerning the safety of a person, vessel, vehicle, or
aircraft"*.

### An example urgency call for medical advice

> PAN-PAN, PAN-PAN, PAN-PAN
>
> Lyngby Radio, Lyngby Radio, Lyngby Radio *(identification)*
>
> THIS IS KDY DS37 #1, KDY DS37 #1 *(identification)*
>
> OUR POSITION IS 55° 45.370'N, 012° 38.519'E *(position as coordinates or a
> bearing and distance **from** a charted mark)*
>
> We have a 1 crew member complaining of chest pains and numbness in his arm.
> *(situation and number of persons involved)*
>
> Requesting medical advice. *(type of assistance needed)*
>
> There are 5 persons on board. *(total number of persons on board)*
>
> OVER.

## Distress Call (MAYDAY)

A distress situation: *"a person, vessel, vehicle, or aircraft is in grave and
imminent danger, and immediate assistance is required"*.

### MIPDANIO

A useful mnemonic to remember the information required to communicate on a
distress call is MIPDANIO:

- **M** - MAYDAY, MAYDAY, MAYDAY
- **I** - Identification (e.g., "THIS IS KDY DS37 #1, KDY DS37 #1, KDY DS37
  #1")
- **P** - Position (given as coordinates or bearing and distance *from* a
  charted object)
- **D** - Distress nature (e.g., fire, sinking, man overboard, etc.)
- **A** - Assistance required (e.g., we require firefighting equipment, pumps,
  assistance recovering a MOB, etc.)
- **N** - Number of persons on board.
- **I** - Any other useful information to rescuers (e.g., "we are a 37-foot
  white sailing yacht")
- **O** - OVER

### An example distress call for a vessel sinking

> MAYDAY, MAYDAY, MAYDAY
>
> THIS IS KDY DS37 #1, KDY DS37 #1, KDY DS37 #1 *(identification)*
>
> OUR POSITION IS 130° FROM SKOVSHOVED HAVN, DISTANCE 2 MILES *(position as
> bearing and distance **from** a charted mark, or as coordinates)*
>
> We are sinking.  *(Nature of distress)*
>
> Request immediate assistance. *(Assistance required)*
>
> There are 5 persons on board. *(total number of persons on board)*
>
> We are firing a red parachute flare. We have no liferaft or survival suits.
>
> OVER
