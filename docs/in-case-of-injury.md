# In case of injury (detailed)

1. If somebody is injured (remember, it might be the instructor) whilst sailing,
  protect people before property.
2. Stop the accident and secure yourself – make sure the accident does not get
  worse or somebody else gets hurt.
3. If somebody isn’t breathing or doesn’t have a pulse, they need immediate help.
    - Use CPR.
    - Call emergency services on 112 or call MAYDAY on VHF channel 16.
    - Call emergency services also if someone is unconscious.
    - Give the boat’s position (for instance in relation to the harbour).
4. Try to put a breathing unconscious person in the recovery position on the
  cockpit floor. If the injured person is conscious, keep talking to them, ask
  them about any medical conditions.
5. The priority is to get the injured person ashore. 2-3 people should help the
   injured person on board and also ashore. The club RIB motor boat is there
   for safety needs. KDY members on VHF channels P1 and P2 can help. 
6. If a hospital check is considered, then do it. Impacts to the head from the
   boom, water inhalation (secondary drowning), suspected fractures, shock, and
   hypothermia are all injuries that need hospital treatment. 
7. To go to hospital, first call 1813 for a recommendation on which hospital
   emergency room to go to. Use a car or call a taxi to get there. Call 112 if
   paramedic treatment or an ambulance are needed or if the injured person
   requests it.
8. Depending on the situation, the remaining crew may be able to bring the boat
   back to harbour and moor it. Mooring alongside a jetty might be easier than
   the correct place. An alternative is to lower the sails and leave the boat
   anchored at sea.
9. Make sure unaffected instructors know about the accident. Make a call to
   them on the VHF or call and SMS other instructors on their mobiles.
10. There is a heart starter (AED) at the harbour office. Many people at the
    harbour are trained in first aid. There are first aid kits in the club
    houses and smaller ones on club boats. Shout for help if you need it.
11. Afterwards, report the accident as an incident in the log book and also to
    KDY sailing school coordinator.
