# About the DS37 Manual

This manual is intended to be a comprehensive operating manual for the KDY DS37
Match Racer within the KDY International Sailing School. It is not intended to
be a replacement for theoretical or practical sailing instruction, nor a
replacement for certifications.

# Objectives

1. To enable a competent skipper and crew to sail and operate a DS37 in a
   manner consistent with how the yachts are used within the KDY International
   Sailing School.
2. To serve as a living document and reference for students and skippers of ISS
   to learn from and contribute to as they continue to sail the vessel.

No aspect of the yacht's operation is considered too obvious for this manual,
but a working knowledge of nautical terms and ropework is needed. Consult the
early pages within the RYA Competent Crew book or ask an instructor if in
doubt.

!!! note
    There is often more than one approach to a particular process. This manual
    strives to recommend a safe and reasonable "default" approach. Alternative
    approaches may also be documented, where appropriate.

    __The conditions on the day, the competence of the crew, and ultimately the
    discretion of the skipper all affect the choice of approach to any given
    situation. Use common sense and let this manual be a guide, not a strict
    set of rules never to be deviated from.__

# Description

The DS 37 Match Racer is an 11.25-metre (36.9 ft) long sloop rigged sailing
yacht, designed by Jacob Vierø in 1991 and used in the Stena Match Cup Sweden,
part of the World Match Racing Tour. The design of the boat includes an
oversized rudder and simple controls. The boat is popular as a teaching boat
for beginners as well because of its simplicity and robustness. However, in
Match racing, it is one of the most physically demanding boats found in the
international match racing circuit. The boat is used mainly in the Scandinavian
countries, where it can be found as inventory of several of the big yacht
clubs, such as the Royal Danish Yacht Club or the Royal Gothenburg Yacht Club.
