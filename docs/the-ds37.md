# Description

The DS 37 Match Racer is an 11.25-metre (36.9 ft) long sloop rigged sailing
yacth, designed by Jacob Vierø in 1991 and used in the Stena Match Cup Sweden,
part of the World Match Racing Tour. The design of the boat includes an
oversized rudder and simple controls. The boat is popular as a teaching boat
for beginners as well because of its simplicity and robustness. However, in
Match racing, it is one of the most physically demanding boats found in the
international matchracing circuit. The boat is used mainly in the Scandinavian
countries, where it can be found as inventory of several of the big yacht
clubs, such as the Royal Danish Yacht Club or the Royal Gothenburg Yacht Club.
