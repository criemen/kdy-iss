# Tacking

1. Look around to ensure there is no risk before changing course.
2. The helm calls "ready about" or "ready to tack" and the crew prepares the
   headsail sheets.
3. When the crew is ready, helm calls "helm to lee" or "tacking" and the bow
   turns upwind.
4. When the bow is head-to-wind, the crew releases the old headsail sheet
   (making sure it can run free) and quickly hauls in the new one.
5. The headsail begins to fill, and the crew trims in the sail.

# Gybing (controlled)

1. Look around to ensure there is no risk before changing course.
2. The helm calls "ready to gybe" or "standby to gybe", the crew release the
   preventer (if rigged) and sheets in the mainsail to center.
3. When the mainsail is centered the helm calls "gybing" and turns to bring the
   stern through the wind.
4. The main comes over. Sheet the headsail on the new leeward side and release
   the old headsail sheet.
5. Ease out the mainsheet.
6. Crew makes final adjusments to sail trim and rigs the preventer again (if
   using a preventer).

# Heaving to

1. The helm calls "heaving to".
2. The bow is brought through the wind, just like when tacking.
3. The original headsail sheet is left tight, so that the headsail backs.
4. The mainsheet is eased to depower the main.
5. The helm fixes the rudder to turn the boat upwind.
