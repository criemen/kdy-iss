# DS37 Manual

This manual is intended to be a comprehensive operating manual for the KDY DS37
Match Racer within the KDY International Sailing School. It is not intended to
be a replacement for theoretical or practical sailing instruction.

## Objectives

- To enable a competent skipper and crew to sail and operate a DS37 in a manner
  consistent with how the yachts are used within the KDY International Sailing
  School. 
- To serve as a living document and reference for students and skippers of ISS
  to learn from and contribute to as they continue to sail the vessel.

No aspect of the yacht's operation is considered too obvious for this manual,
but a working knowledge of nautical terms and ropework is needed. Consult the
early pages within the RYA Competent Crew book or ask another ISS member if in
doubt.

!!! note

    There will often be more than one approach to a particular process. This
    manual strives to recommend a safe and reasonable "default" approach.
    Alternative approaches may also be documented, where appropriate.

    __The conditions on the day, the competence of the crew, and ultimately the
    discretion of the skipper are all required to make the best choice of approach
    to any given situation. Use common sense and let this manual be a guide, not a
    strict set of rules never to be deviated from.__

## The DS37 Match Racer

### Description
The DS 37 Match Racer is an 11.25-metre (36.9 ft) long sloop rigged sailing
yacth, designed by Jacob Vierø in 1991 and used in the Stena Match Cup Sweden,
part of the World Match Racing Tour. The design of the boat includes an
oversized rudder and simple controls. The boat is popular as a teaching boat
for beginners as well because of its simplicity and robustness. However, in
Match racing, it is one of the most physically demanding boats found in the
international matchracing circuit. The boat is used mainly in the Scandinavian
countries, where it can be found as inventory of several of the big yacht
clubs, such as the Royal Danish Yacht Club or the Royal Gothenburg Yacht Club.

## Safety

Like any sport, sailing is not without risk. Ensure you have read and
understood this section, as common mistakes documented here can prevent injury.

### Persons over property

The safety of persons is of paramount importance, and always takes priority
over safety of property. If faced with any situation where either a person will
come to harm OR property will be damaged, *always* prioritize the safety of
persons. Things can be replaced, people can not.

A common mistake that beginners make is to try to stop the boat from coming
into contact with a piling or other vessel by using their feet, hands, or
fingers. The sheer momentum of these vessels will surprise you and will result
in injury, so use fenders instead of limbs.

### Secure footing and staying onboard

Staying onboard and preventing falls is critical on any yacht, and the DS37 is
no different. Always follow _"one hand for the boat, one hand for yourself"_ as
you move around on the yacht. Stay low, move methodically, and avoid rushing,
running, or jumping. Being an older yacht the non-skid on the deck is not as
aggressive and "grippy" as on a newer vessel, so take care. Quality sailing
boots or shoes that provide adequate grip are important, but need not
expensive. Avoid stepping on lines or sails, as both are common causes of slips
or falls. Bad enough if you fall and hurt yourself, but worse to fall
overboard.

!!! note
    The majority of man overboard incidents happen in the harbor. Stay
    vigilant.

### Man Overboard (MOB)

- Shout "Man Overboard!" so that everyone is aware of the situation.
- Throw the floating horseshoe lifering to the casualty, even if they have a
  lifejacket. It will serve as a datum, a method of floatation, and may assist
  with hauling the casualty onboard.
- Assign a person to point at the casualty and maintain constant visual
  contact. This person should never take their eyes off of the casualty in the
  water.
- The skipper will use the VHF or delegate the crew to use VHF to inform the
  other KDY boats or indeed to call for assistance on VHF 16, as appropriate.
- The skipper will decide the appropriate manouever to position the yacht
  alongside the casualty to recover them.
- The crew will recover the casualty, taking care not to get into the water.

!!! Warning
    If there is *any* doubt about a swift or safe recovery, call for assistance
    on VHF 16. The Maritime SAR Convention defines the distress phase as *"a
    situation wherein there is reasonable certainty that a person, a vessel or
    other craft is threatened by grave and imminent danger and requires immediate
    assistance"*.

    __A man overboard at sea in anything but the calmest conditions or warmest
    waters is *almost always* an urgency or distress situation.__

### Cold Water Survival Times Without Protective Clothing
Loss of dexterity and the ability to manipulate fingers, exhaustion or
unconsciousness, and death to drowning or hypothermia can happen more quickly
than most people realize if they are not familiar with cold water survival
times.

!!! Warning
    A casualty in the water with only a buoyancy aid (i.e., not a proper
    lifejacket designed to turn an unconcious casualty upright and keep their
    airway clear of the water) is almost certain to drown upon loss of
    conciousness.

| Water Temperature Degrees C | Water Temperature Degrees F | Loss of Dexterity | Exhaustion or Unconsciousness | Expected Time of Survival |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 0.3 | 32.5 | Under 2 minutes | Under 15 minutes | Under 15 to 45 minutes |
| 0.3 to 4.5 | 32.5 to 40 | Under 3 minutes | 15 to 30 minutes | 30 to 90 minutes |
| 4.5 to 10 | 40 to 50 | Under 5 minutes | 30 to 60 minutes | 1 to 3 hours |
| 10 to 15.5 | 50 to 60 | 10 to 15 minutes | 1 to 2 hours | 1 to 6 hours |
| 15.5 to 21 | 60 to 70 | 30 to 40 minutes | 2 to 7 hours | 2 to 40 hours |
| 21 to 26.5 | 70 - 80 | 1 to 2 hours | 2 to 12 hours | 3 hours to indefinite |
| Over 26.5 | Over 80 | 2 to 12 hours | Indefinnite | Indefinite |


### The boom

The boom on the DS37 is not particularly low, but it always presents a
potential danger as it comes across the deck of the yacht. Make sure to always
keep your head low and clear of the boom during any tacking or gybing
manouevres. Calling out "HEADS!" is a good way to remind anyone not paying
attention during a manouevre to keep low, so duck your head low if you hear it.

A common mistake on the DS37 is that the helmsman stands too far forward when
on the tiller which can result in being struck by the end of the boom as it
comes across. Use the tiller while seated just aft of the mainsheet on the
windward side. If you must stand while on the helm, be sure to stand far aft
enough to avoid being hit by the boom end.

### The tiller

The rudder on the DS37 is massively oversized for manouverability, which means
that the yacht is quite nimble. One side effect of this is that the lower
portion of the tiller which connects the rudder shaft to the tiller extension
can exert extreme forces and is the perfect height to take out ankles. Take
care not to stand within the swinging path of this lever, as it can easily
break an ankle or foot if the rudder swings violently.

### Mass and momentum

The DS37 is a relatively heavy vessel with tremendous momentum. It should go
without saying that a collision with any significant speed on can and will
cause serious damage to persons or property.

During berthing of the vessel, lines will be taken aboard from the pilings and
used to slow the vessel's forward progress. You cannot stop the vessel in an
instant (and attempting to do so will likely result in injury), so walk along
the deck with the line to slowly absorb the momentum of the yacht ("bend, don't
break").

## Sail Handling

### Preparing the mainsail

1. Remove the sail cover
2. Attach the halyard to the head of the mainsail, ensuring it is not wrapped
   on the mast
3. Ensure the mainsheet is flaked to run free and has a figure-of-eight stopper
   knot at the end.
4. Ensure the vang, cunningham, and outhaul are loose (but do not have exessive
   slack)
5. Remove all sail ties from the mainsail

### Hoisting the mainsail

1. Bring the yacht head-to-wind.
2. Ensure the vang, cunningham, and outhaul are slack (but do not have exessive
   slack that could tangle).
3. Ensure all sail ties are removed from the mainsail.
4. Send a person to the starboard side of the mast to hoist the mainsail by
   hauling on the mainsail halyard. This person must coordinate with the person
   on the starboard jammers and winch to take up the slack as the main is
   raised.
5. Keep a close eye on the mainsail as it's raised to ensure no fouling or
   jams. Stop if neccesary.
6. Tension the mainsail halyard using the winch so that the luff is tight, but
   not overly so.
7. Tidy the remainder of the halyard and stow it inside.

### Reefing the mainsail

!!! Tip

    The DS37 is ususally not rigged with a reefing line of sufficient length to
    be able to preemptively rig the reefing line but still raise the full mainsail.
    If the weather forecast calls for a reef in the main at any point later in your
    sail, it's best to rig and reef the mainsail from the beginning. Reefing the
    main while already underway in overpowered conditions can be quite challenging,
    and is best avoided unless necessary.

1. Bring the yacht head-to-wind.
2. Ensure the vang, cunningham, and outhaul are slack (but do not have exessive
   slack that could tangle)
3. Rig the reefing pennant using either of the reefing pennant variations
   outlined below.
4. Send a person to the windward side of the mast to partially hoist the
   mainsail and hook the reefing cringle to the rams horn.
5. Once the forward cringle is secure on the rams horn, continue to hoist the
   mainsail and tension.
6. Tension the the new outhaul by hauling in on the reefing pennant. The foot
   of the sail should be bar tight, but take care not to overdo it.
7. Tidy the foot of the sail using the elastic sail ties. If the mainsail is
   loose-footed, tie the foot of the sail through the reef points to itself. If
   the mainsail foot is run through the track in the boom, the foot of the sail
   will need to be tied through the reef points and to the boom.
8. Tidy the remainder of the halyard and stow it inside.

!!! Warning
    If the foot of the sail is tied to the boom (and not to itself), you must
    be *absolutely certain* to remove the reefing tidy lines prior to shaking out
    the reef and raising the mainsail. Failure to do so will rip the mainsail. 

#### Reefing Pennant Variation 1 - Fixed Eye
1. Open the reefing pennant jammer
2. Haul sufficient slack in by pulling on the reefing pennant at the end of the
   boom
3. Remove the stopper knot in the reefing pennant
4. Run the reefing pennant from the boom end through the reefing cringle at the
   leech of the mainsail
5. Continue down and through the small metal eye on the underside of the boom
   below the reefing cringle
6. Secure with a fixed bowline.

#### Reefing Pennant Variation 2 - Running Bowline
1. Open the reefing pennant jammer
2. Haul sufficient slack in by pulling on the reefing pennant at the end of the
   boom
3. Remove the stopper knot in the reefing pennant
4. Run the reefing pennant from the boom end through the reefing cringle at the
   leech of the mainsail
5. Continue down under the foot of the sail and around the boom (make sure the
   pennant is run aft of the small metal eye on the underside of the boom)
6. Secure with a running bowline around the standing end of the reefing pennant.

### Dropping the mainsail
TODO

### Preparing the headsail

1. Attach the headsail tack shackle directly to the rectangular metal eye at
   the foot of the forestay. Ensure that when the sail is raised the shackle
   will not be twisted at a strange angle which would impact the shape of the
   sail. An easy way to test this is to attach the tack shackle and first
   piston hank and pull the first piston hank upwards to see what this bottom
   part will look like when stretched)
2. Begin attaching all the piston hanks to the forestay, starting from the
   bottom of the sail and working your way up.
3. Open the headsail halyard jammer, slacken the headsail halyard sufficient to
   attach it to the head of the headsail using the shackle.
4. Rig the headsail port and starboard sheets. If using the jib, make sure to
   run the sheets through both sheet cars and *inside* the shrouds. If using
   the genoa, run the sheets through the first sheet car (the aftmost sheet
   car) and *outside* the shrouds. Finish each sheet with a bowline to the clew
   of the headsail.

### Raising the headsail

The DS37 has a simpled hanked on headsail with either a jib or genoa. Some jibs
have battens, while others do not.

1. Close the headsail halyard jammer.
2. Haul in on the headsail halyard at the mast and take up slack at the
   starboard jammer winch.
3. Tension the halyard until the headsail luff has appropriate tension.
4. Tidy the remainder of the halyard and stow it inside.
